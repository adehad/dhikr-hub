# Intentions

1. Reset the intention that this is for Allah
2. Try and remember as many people as we can and we hope that the dhikr is able to benefit them all.
   Just by the mercy of the dhikr itself.
3. He (SWT) says that When we remember Him He remembers us.
   He (SWT) gives us an invitation to remember him as he wants to remember us by giving us the opportunity to be in this gatherings.

# Istighfar
Istighfar (ga-fa-ra - to forgive, istag-fa-ra - asks to get forgive(ness)) :

- Don't ask for forgivess
  - unless you believe in his one-ness
  - unless you feel the guilt and the shortcomings
    - not just from sins
    - even in our acts of worship we are heedless (first dhikr after  the prayer's salaam is astaghfirullah)
    - not grateful for all the blessings
      - and the way we ask forgiveness needs forgiveness in itself (for not being ab
- Asks to move from one level to another
    1. forgiveness from disliked acts
    2. for doing permissions things without an intention
    3. for being not connected to Allah for even a moment

# HasbunAllah

All our affairs and issues we rely on

Rely for the purification for hearts and souls and to reach him

What Ibrahim said before his people threw him into the fire

Badr, as they rose despite their wounds


# Salawaat
Salawat we are not doing a favour, we are asking Allah to do it, as we are not at the level to do it

Even when Allah commands us to do so, he is stating that he and the angels are doing it. So already establishing that our salawat means nothing in comparison. So it only benefits us.

Allah does 10 salawat on us, is there even a comparison to us vs Allah doing salawat. What does it mean for Allah to do salawat? As says in the Quran to take us out of the darkness and into the light.

“closer to light and away from darkness”

Imagine that you are standing in the right etiquette and he is alive and behind a screen.

Just reflect many of His Sunnah that we missed, and the state we will be if we were going to meet him SAW. We should be ashamed of our state and remember that fact.

(story of a scholar who wanted to leave the room in shame if He (SAW) entered at that moment).

And he responds to use despite our shortcomings
