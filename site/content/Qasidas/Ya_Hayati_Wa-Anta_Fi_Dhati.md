## About
This version of the qasida omits the original first line, which is also the original title. This is because it is better known as 'Ya Hayati' in the inshād world, and the first line is usually omitted.
In the original poem, al-Imam al-Shushtari repeats the verse 'Yā ḥayātī wa-anta fī dhātī ... ḥāḍirun lā taghīb' at the beginning and after every four verses, for a total of four times — even when the poem is not sung.
