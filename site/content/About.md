# About

بِسْمِ ٱللّٰهِ ٱلرَّحْمٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ

We begin by purifying and resetting the intentions.

## Introduction

Dhikr-Hub was created to consolidate Qasidas and Salawaat from various sources into a single, accessible resource. It aims to present Arabic text, transliteration, and translation in a way that makes it easy for readers to follow, taking inspiration from the intuitive designs of many Quran apps.

The project strives to make spiritual poetry easily accessible to those who wish to recite and study these works. We acknowledge that there may be mistakes and shortcomings, and welcome community contributions to help improve the collection.

## Core Features

- **Arabic text** with proper diacritical marks (tashkeel)
- **Transliterations** following the Library of Congress Arabic Romanization system
- **English translations** that preserve meaning while remaining readable
- **Organised presentation** with clear delineation between chorus and verses
- **Customisable display options** for showing/hiding different elements
- **Mobile-friendly design** for use during gatherings
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities for offline access

## Project Vision

Dhikr-Hub was designed with a vision to help consolidate effort within the community. Currently, various Qasida websites exist in different states of completion, but often there is no clear way to contribute or update them. The maintainers may no longer have the time or resources to keep them updated.

This project provides a framework that addresses these challenges through:

### 1. Easy Community Contribution

The project is structured to make it straightforward for the community to contribute new content and improvements.

### 2. Easy Community Forking

The open-source nature allows people to fork the project should they disagree with aspects or wish to create their own variations.

### 3. Provision for API Deployment and Data Consumption

By storing content in JSON format, the project enables other applications to consume and utilise this data for their own purposes, such as mobile apps or specialised interfaces.

### 4. Offline Access

Dhikr-Hub is built using a static website generator combined with Progressive Web App (PWA) technology, allowing users to access the content offline when needed.

## Content Structure

Each Qasida and Salawaat page follows a consistent structure where the verses are presented first, followed by contextual information about:

- The poem itself and its significance
- The author's background when available
- Sources for the Arabic text, transliteration, and translation

## Join Our Effort

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! Whether you're adding new content, improving existing translations, or enhancing the website's functionality, your contributions help preserve and share these spiritual treasures with the community.
