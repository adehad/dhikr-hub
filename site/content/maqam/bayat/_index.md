Title: Bayat
---

The musical mode (or melody) Bayātī (Arabic {{< arabic_inline "بياتي" />}}), also known as Bayat and Uşşâk (Ushaq), is similar to a natural minor scale, weaves tales of longing and mystery. Its half-flat second degree adds a touch of exoticism.

Close your eyes and step into a bustling bazaar. Bayat weaves through the market stalls, its notes echoing the vibrant colors of silks and spices. It’s the heartbeat of lively celebrations, where joy and sorrow dance together.
