Title: Kurd
---

The musical mode (or melody) Kurd (Arabic {{< arabic_inline "كرد" />}}),  balances major and minor elements, like a twilight sky. Its harmonies resonate with both strength and vulnerability.

Imagine a mountain pass, rugged and majestic. Kurd is the wind sweeping through pine trees, carrying tales of distant lands. Its harmonies blend strength and vulnerability, like a lone eagle soaring above snow-capped peaks.
