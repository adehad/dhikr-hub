Title: Hijaz
---

The musical mode (or melody) Ḥijāz (Arabic {{< arabic_inline "حجاز" />}}), is a mix of Phrygian and harmonic minor scales, Ḥijāz embodies passion and introspection. Its raised third degree tugs at the heartstrings.

Picture moonlit nights in an ancient courtyard. Ḥijāz is the melancholy of unrequited love, the scent of jasmine lingering in the air. Its haunting melodies echo through narrow alleys, touching hearts with their timeless beauty.
