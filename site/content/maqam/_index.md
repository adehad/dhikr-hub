# Maqam (plural: Maqamat)

A concept in Arabic music that represents a specific melodic mode or scale. Think of it as a musical “flavor” or “mood.”

A maqam defines a set of musical notes (like a scale) that create a distinct emotional quality. Each maqam has its own unique pattern of whole steps and half steps.

It is possible that the same Qasida can be sung in multiple different Maqamat.
