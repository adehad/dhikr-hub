Title: Sika
---

The musical mode (or melody) Sīkā (Arabic {{< arabic_inline "سيكا" />}}),  dances between Aeolian and Dorian modes. Picture moonlit gardens and forbidden love—it’s enchanting yet bittersweet.

Sīkā is a hidden garden, lush and mysterious. Its melodies bloom like exotic flowers, their petals kissed by moonbeams. Close your eyes, and you’ll hear whispers of forgotten love stories and forbidden desires.
