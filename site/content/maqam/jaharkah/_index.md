Title: Jaharkah
---

The musical mode (or melody) Jahārkāh (Arabic {{< arabic_inline "جهاركاه" />}}),  is a blend of Dorian and Lydian modes, with unexpected twists. It’s like a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.

Jahārkāh is a hidden oasis in a barren landscape. Its music flows like a secret stream, inviting weary travelers to rest. It whispers of forgotten legends, of courage and resilience against all odds.
