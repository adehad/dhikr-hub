Title: Nawahand
---

The musical mode (or melody) Nawāhand (Arabic {{< arabic_inline "نواهند" />}}), is reminiscent of Mixolydian, heralds new beginnings. Its raised second degree whispers of hope and transformation.


Nawāhand is the first light of dawn, painting the sky with hues of pink and gold. Its melodies awaken the soul, stirring memories of lost loves and unfulfilled dreams. Listen closely—it holds the promise of new beginnings.
