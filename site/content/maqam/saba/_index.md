Title: Saba
---

The musical mode (or melody) Ṣabā (Arabic {{< arabic_inline "صبا" />}}), with  its lowered second degree, mirrors the Phrygian scale. It’s a tearful melody, mourning lost civilizations and unfulfilled dreams.

Ṣabā is rain tapping on ancient windows. It weeps for lost cities buried in sands, for poets who penned verses under moonlight. Its minor notes carry the weight of centuries, a lament for what once was.
