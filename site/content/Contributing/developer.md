## Word by Word

This feature is implemented as part of the `verse` shortcode.
As some translations may involve more poetic translations or otherwise translate multiple words
together, making it harder to read the Arabic verse, I've moved away from using this as the default.

But may be useful for you regardless.

Have a look at this example:

{{< verse file="salawaat/example" lang="en" >}}
